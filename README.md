# Disclaimer
I had to complete the game and some of its remaining features over the course of a couple days after my final report was submitted.
I apologize for this, but I've recently come down with some potentially very serious health conditions that have been seriously
impacting my day-to-day activity. I've been sleeping for 16+ hours per day and have been bedridden for most of the time I've
been awake. I didn't send an email because I thought I'd be able to do everything in time despite this, but I was wrong.
So again, sorry for the extra time that I took to complete this, but I hope this is still a quality submission!
